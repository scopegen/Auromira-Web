                            <p>One of the most loved water parks in India, Wonder World Water Park
                            has been touching hearts since long. In the recent times the Water Park
                            was looking forward to give a fresh new look to its website and its
promotion strategy, when it came up to us.</p>

                            <p>It was a challenge, indeed, for Auromira Entertainment to redesign the
                            identity of the Water Park, also not letting its soul essence vanish
                            completely. The quintessential Indian holiday pretty much means
                            hopping straight into the beach, and that, we took as a hint and
decided to move forward.</p>

                            <p>Like an oasis in the desert, Wonder World Water Park wanted to stand
                            out and be noticed. With bright, bold colors and eye-popping graphics,
                            their new website sought to accomplish that goal. Located in Puri,
                            Odisha Wonder World wanted to offer their customers the appeal of an
escape from the bustle of daily life to enjoy the surf and fun of the park.</p>

                            <h1>Logo</h1>
                            <p>Wonder World wished to refresh its identity but not to lose its root values, as the water park was popular among
                            the fun lovers of Odisha already. We decided not to dismantle the logo completely and rather just tweak it a little.
                            After much iteration, we settled on a portrayal of a 'beach view', with a setting-sun, a coconut tree and ocean- wave,
                            which touches all the spatial and thematic factors surrounding Wonder World Water Park. Our designing team re-shifted the colors
and changed the positioning of the text a little and the new logo was good to go. </p>


                            <h1>Tagline</h1>
                            <p>A fun zone as such needed a tagline that reflected the same energy and excitement as swirling through one of the rides in the Water Park would bring.
                            We had the word ‘fun’ in the back of our minds. Then we decided to give it a ‘desi touch’. Thinking and brainstorming for hours got no results as per
                            our expectations, when out of the blue the tagline came up to someone’s mind in the team- ‘Fun Idhar Hai!’
We as well as Wonder World found the tagline to be perfectly suiting the Water Park, thus, the tagline was frozen. </p>


                            <h1>Website</h1>
                            <p>The website of Wonder World was redesigned looking at it through a kid’s eye. Colourful, bright,
                            vibrant background and bright &bold fonts became the base and the work began. We realized that a website as
                            such would require a bonus visually appealing interface, thus we stuck to this formula. In a time of a month,
with experts in web designing and development at Auromira, the website got ready to go online. The response that came up thereafter was unexpectedly amazing!</p>



                            <h1>Promotion</h1>
                            <p>We, at Auromira took it as a challenge to promote Wonder World in a way that it never gets out of people’s mind. From social media management to advertising the newest version of Wonder World offline, from creating campaigns in order to know ‘what the consumers want’ to arranging campaigns to promote certain offers and deals, we left no stones unturned to boost the online and offline presence of the Water Park.

                            We ran a Google Search campaign aimed at directing users to their ticketing page. We made sure we were always bidding higher than competitors, ensuring us the #1 position in Google Search results.

                            We ran Google Display ads aimed at retargeting to recent visitors of Wonder World Water Park website, reminding them to purchase if they haven’t already.

                            Finally, we ran Facebook lead forms campaigns aimed at collecting email addresses for Wonder World Water park newsletter and aimed at increasing brand awareness.

                            We ran various attractive deals like ‘Wow Wednesday’, ‘Silver Ticket’ as well as organized a number of events at the venue like ‘Big Nite 2020’ and ‘Holi Bash 2020’ to
                            attract more and more people to the Water Park. Our creative team developed videos and posters highlighting the Water Park and the facilities,
and in no time the visibility of Wonder World grew doubly.</p>



                            <p>After the re-branding and promotions Wonder World Water Park is getting a crowd of thousands and is standing as a benchmark in the market.
