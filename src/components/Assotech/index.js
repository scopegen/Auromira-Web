                            <p>Assotech Limited is a Delhi based real estate developer.  They have excellent brand recognition and market presence. They touted themselves to be providing  ‘Next Generation Spaces' for quite some time and used that theme in their branding and advertising. As the company grew stronger in the market and decided to nestle in Odisha, they planned to come up with a whole new strategy to redefine their brand, adding a touch of Odisha to it, thus, tied up with Auromira Entertainment.
Being ‘local’ isn't a top priority for customers looking to buy or sell a home. Instead there are these seven importance factor that affects the real estate buying-selling in the market:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Honesty</li>
                                <li>Ethnicity</li>
                                <li>Communication</li>
                                <li>Availability</li>
                                <li>Experience in the market</li>
                                <li>Knowledge (financing, inspections, staging, etc.)</li>
                            </ul>


                            <h1>Research resources</h1>
                            <p>We came up with a new strategy and initiated a campaign to bring Assotech Pride into new lights.
                            This campaign included producing commercials inspired by the new importance factors featuring our proposed new tagline and brand strategy.
To tie everything together, we produced mockups of new colors, fonts and graphics as applied to their brand identity, print and online material.</p>
                            <h1>Brand Refresh</h1>
                            <p>We knew we didn’t want to change their brand too much as we all know that brand consistency is the key, but a refresh was definitely in order.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Brochure Design</li>
                                <li>Campaign Strategy</li>
                                <li>Campaign Tag</li>
                                <li>Collateral Design</li>
                                <li>Digital Ad Design</li>
                                <li>Event Planning</li>
                                <li>Front & Backend Development</li>
                                <li>Interactive Check-In Form</li>
                                <li>Out-of-Home Advertising</li>
                                <li>Promotional Item Design</li>
                                <li>Social Media</li>
                                <li>Tagline Development</li>
                                <li>Website Design and Development</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h1>Logo</h1>
                            <p>We gave a brand new logo to the Odishan version of it, with a semi circle Konark Chakra in white with a background of blue.
We kept the dark blue as it emits a sophisticated and unwavering presence and also the font to retain the soul of it.</p>

                            <h1>Tagline</h1>
                            <p>Deciding the tagline is always toiling, so it was for us. Brainstorming for hours, jumbling out the features 'pride' and 'Odisha', playing with words,
we finally clicked at a point of freezing it on - 'The Pride of Odisha'. </p>

                            <p>By leveraging positive emotions, the ‘Pride of Odisha’ concept complements all of the importance factors. It also refines the underlying message
of their former tagline 'Next Generation Spaces' as well as the fact that a real estate company cares more about its customers- the people of Odisha.</p>


                            <h1>Website</h1>
                            <p>After deciding upon the tagline, now it was our job to reflect the same pride into their website.
                            Our web developers poured their years of experience into framing out a web-space that defines their philosophy well, as well as creates confidence in
                            the consumers about the company. The final framework that came out combining the efforts of the web developers, the content creators and the designers was
something unbelievably perfect.</p>

                            <h1>Promotion</h1>
                            <p>Alongside the development of the website, our digital marketing and marketing team started strategizing the plan to be worked out in order to create and sustain the brand in the online as well as the offline platforms.
                            Every brand that comes to Odisha enters into an already placed challenge of a ‘family-man’ living, or rather a ‘joint family’ lifestyle. To incorporate a plan that is both modern as well as touching this very sense of ‘family’ was a challenge for Assotech, and thus, for us.
                            Our team made sure this very need of implementing a ‘sense of modernization’ and ‘not leaving the roots’ is put into the prime focus.
The content and design team then crafted creatives that reflect the same.</p>



                            <p>From social media like Facebook and Twitter to a number of hoardings, printables, activations and campaigns, our team rolled up sleeves to imprint the brand into the hearts of the people of Odisha. After months of constant efforts and hard work, with the finest of plan of action, Assotech Limited got its niche in the market, as well as in the confidence of people.
In an established real estate market of the flexibility of the builders of adding extra charges later, and a set mindset of the people of nodding to it, Assotech Pride is a breakthrough. We formulated designs that disrupted the conventional real estate market. </p>

                            <p>Now as the construction is going in full swing, the marketing and advertising are also leaving no stones unturned to keep up to their expectations.</p>
                            <p>In the present day, even before the apartments are ready, with the hard work of Auromira Entertainment and open hand support from Assotech Limited, the apartments are fully booked and  the people of Odisha as well as from other parts of India are ready to have their 'home' at Assotech Pride.</p>
