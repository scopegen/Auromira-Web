                  <p>Gupta Distributors is one of the leading electronics retail dealers in India. While they’ve been well known for years, nationwide, the growing competition in the market presented a strong opportunity for growth. Gupta Distributors wanted to get a fresh-new look and identity in the market in order to make greater difference in its market presence. It approached Auromira Entertainment for the same, and the story that went is something like this...
We started out by analyzing Gupta Distributors' two main demographics (the history and present day analytics) so that we could develop a 
campaign strategy that was tailored to effectively reach both. To drive more traffic to each event, sell more product, and create follow-up
opportunities, marketing efforts were formulated for pre-launch (to build awareness), during each event (to elevate excitement, track success, and ensure
re-marketing opportunity), and post launch (to follow up on the data collected during each event).</p>

<h1>Logo</h1>
<p>
Gupta Distributors did not have a crafted logo; rather they were using the name itself. Auromira Entertainment came up with a logo that reflects the ‘traditionalism’ that the retail chain believes in. Adding up shades of red, green and yellow and just the initials, the logo of Gupta Distributors came to the present form. </p>

<h1>Tagline</h1>
<p>The only trick that works in the market is ‘trust’. That is what Gupta Distributors has been standing with the same USP since 1972. We decided not to alter that at all, and the tagline came out to be ‘Symbol of Trust’. </p>

<h1>Website</h1>
<p>Not exaggerating the interface with fancy features was the only philosophy before getting started with the website development. Gupta Distributors believes in ‘simple living and high thinking’, hence we stuck upon doing the same for their website. Keeping the same ‘traditional’ theme as the logo, our web development team framed out the website with bright and eye catchy colours as red, yellow and white and just the product details, and as we thought, it worked! </p>

<h1>Promotions</h1>
<p>Our advertising and promotions team rolled up sleeves and got into discovering all possible methods and strategies to promote and establish this newest face of Gupta Distributors in the market. Gupta Distributors already was a renowned retailer, hence it was important that this fresh new look of it is equally loved by its customers. Hence we set up a number of campaigns, hoardings, in-shop promotions, sent out printables, created social media pages for it and promoted their business there with posters, videos, attractive offers and contests, and the response we got was amazing.</p> 

<p>Elevating a brand requires telling a story that builds its value. For Gupta Distributors, this meant creating a whole new design language to spotlight the beauty, innovation and utility of its products, then crafting a journey that facilitates engagement throughout the digital shopping process. 
Keeping that in mind, the whole process of branding and promotion was executed.</p> 
<p>Does your brand need a strategy? Of course it does! Strategy is the backbone of marketing -- from the brand voice and personality portrayed across all marketing material to the look and feel of websites and videos, and the tone of your social media posts. If your brand and marketing are a bit lackluster, contact us to help get it back on track to better performance and results!</p>
